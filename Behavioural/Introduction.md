Hello, my name is Nitesh and I am currently employed as an SDE3 at Meesho. I am a part of the Supplier Acquisition and Activation team, as well as the Cataloging team. Our team is responsible for managing the supplier onboarding process and their catalogs, while also engaging them on the platform through various programs like referrals and incentives. The technology stack that I use includes Java with Springboot, Kafka, Redis, MySQL, and our server is hosted on AWS EKS.

Prior to my current role, I have worked in the fintech and telecommunications domain where I have gained experience working across full stacks. During my previous roles, I have worked with technologies such as React, Node, Mongo, and PHP.

**Weakness**
- Sometime I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute  quickly, it also means that I sometimes makes careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always  have someone else double check my work.
- wihtout thinking much depth of it, creates a trouble.

**Behavioural Questions.**
1. What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen to the team?
2. What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?
