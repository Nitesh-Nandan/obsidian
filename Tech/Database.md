**Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**
- A clustered index is an index that specifies the physical arrangement of a database's table records. There can only be one clustered index per table since there can only be one method that records are physically maintained in a database table. It stores the records inÂ sorted order.

- A cluster index is a type of index that sorts the data rows in the table on their key values, whereas the Non-clustered index stores the data at one location and indices at another location.

- Clustered index stores data pages in the leaf nodes of the index, while the Non-clustered index method never stores data pages in the leaf nodes of the index.

- The cluster index doesnâ€™t require additional disk space, whereas the Non-clustered index requires additional disk space.

- Cluster index offers faster data access, on the other hand, the Non-clustered index is slower.

- A Non-clustered index stores the data at one location and indices at another location. The index contains pointers to the location of that data. A single table can have many non-clustered indexes as an index in the non-clustered index is stored in different places.

### Sharding vs Partitioning

**Sharding**: Spliting a database across muliple instances.
**Partitioning**: Spliting a subset of data within same instances.

Partitioning  happens in a data label, while Sharding happens database level.
