## FAQ

**Q. If we want to modify/update a file, how to do that?**
- GFS doesn't support the modify/update operation. So the solution is simple: we delete the old file, and write a new one(the modified one) from scratch.
- **Reason:** If the chunk becomes larger or smaller after the modification, how to handle remaining data in subsequent chunks. This will evnetually lead to rewrite-like operation

**Q. How to identify whether a chunk on the disk is broken?**
- We can calculate the checksum for each chunk and use it to detect the error.
